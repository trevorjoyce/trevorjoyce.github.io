  <center> <p> In the midst of spring practice, a former five star prospect is finally
  starting to make waves around town. Mecole Hardman, the former "do it all" athlete
  in high school spent his first year in a Georgia uniform learning the ropes
  on how to play defensive back. Considering he didn't play too much of it in
  high school, Hardman didn't see the field too much his freshman year
  besides some special teams.</p>
  <p> However, whether it be a lack of recruiting, production, or injuries,
  it has become apparent that the wide reciever position is a concern to Head
  Coach Kirby Smart. So, with a year of college under his belt, Mecole, who
  always figured to eventually find his way on offense, is finally starting
  to take reps with the wide recievers.</p>
  <p> Although spring practice has only gone on for a little over a week, Mecole
  has quickly become the talk of the town, making circus like catches in practice
  and looking like a natural fit on offense. He has even been seen running the
  wild cat package with Terry Godwin, taking handoffs at running back. </p>
  <p> Whether or not we see Mecole taking snaps on offense at the annual G Day
  game on the 22nd, it should only be a matter of time before we see him on
  offense at some point this season. <p/> </center>

<center> <p> As you can see from the chart above, the dawgs don't have much production
returning as the lead wide out McKenzie left for the NFL. With an up and coming
sophomore quarterback in Jacob Eason, it will be imperative this year to find
him recievers who can be consistant and productive. Only time will tell if
the Mecole Hardman experiment will work out on offense, but one can only hope that
he can become the next two way star at UGA and follow in the footsteps of Georgia
legends Hines Ward and Champ Bailey. </p> </center>
